<div class="information w-1">
    <p>I am a Professor in the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.
        My research focuses on machine learning and data mining. Specifically, much of our work aims at feature selection,
        trustworthy (robust, fair and interpretable) artificial intelligence, time series forecasting and privacy preservation.
        Our work directly benefits applications such as computer vision, natural language process, software engineering,
        speech recognition, cloud computing and real-world robust learning systems.</p>
